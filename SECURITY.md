# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We don't backport security updates to previous versions.
All security updates and bug fixes are rolled out in patch updates for the current version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

DON'T open an issue to report a security problem.
Instead, use
the [GitHub Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/reporting-a-vulnerability-in-your-repository)
in
the [GitHub repository for `structurizr-d2-exporter`](https://github.com/goto1134/structurizr-d2-exporter/security/advisories).

Your report should include the steps to reproduce the issue, if applicable, and its impact on security.
Avoid including sensitive information and instead focus on disclosing enough information
so that others will understand the nature and extent of the vulnerability.

## Disclosure Policy

When the vulnerability reported is confirmed, efforts will be made to promptly resolve the issue.
Keep in mind that due to resource constraints, solution timelines may vary.
